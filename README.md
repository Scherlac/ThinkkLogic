# ThinkkLogic

**Description**

Thinkk Logic is an easy to learn mastermind puzzle game. 

**Compatibility**

The current version runs on Windows Desktop and Phone.  I also added a new version recently which is based on Blazor so now you can test your skills online [here](https://thinkkblazor.azurewebsites.net/gameboard). Note that the online version uses WebAssembly. 


**Development**

This program was started under Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition written in C#. 

The program of this game was prepared to support multiple level of the puzzle. Currently the game starts with level 1. 

	- Level 1: only five colors are used (no holes and no black) and no duplicates are allowed.   
	- Level 2: six colors are used, holes and duplicated are also allowed.
